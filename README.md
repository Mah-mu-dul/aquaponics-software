# Aquaponics Software

## Introduction

Welcome to the Aquaponics Software project! This project focuses on developing an IoT-based aquaponics farming system. Our goal is to create a user-friendly front-end interface that allows users to monitor and manage their aquaponics systems effectively.

## Project Overview

Aquaponics is a sustainable farming method that combines aquaculture (raising fish) and hydroponics (growing plants in water). By integrating these two systems, we can create a symbiotic environment where both fish and plants thrive.

### Objectives

- Develop an intuitive front-end interface for users.
- Implement real-time monitoring of water quality, fish health, and plant growth.
- Provide users with actionable insights to optimize their aquaponics systems.
